                            active listening skills whilst leaving their own agendas and egos at the door.With business mentoring additional
                            overall business experience is needed or specialist experience that is valuable to all types of business e.g IT.

                        How can I Get The Most Out Of A Mentoring Relationship?

                        <p>
                            From the beginning establish a working relationship, timescales,expections,boundaries and objectives.Be
                            open to feedback,honest and willing to share relevant information.Be ready to develop new ways of thinking,
                            behaviours and attitudes. Prepare for the mentoring process, setting goals,priorities,realistic expectations and
                            always review your progress.Ensure that objectives set are achievable and realistic.i.e.to achieve sales of figures
                            higher than Microsoft in six months is probably unrealistic.


                            A mentorship is especially productive when the mentor believes in the mentee and if thee mentor can learn from
                            the mentee as mentoring is a two-way relationship.
